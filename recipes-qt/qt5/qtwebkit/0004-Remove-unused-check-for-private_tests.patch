Subject: [PATCH] Remove unused check for private_tests
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

It turns out that qt_developer_build is never used anyway.

I did some git archeology and it looks like it was nuked when doing the
5.2 merge from upstream. The original purpose was apparently to control
-Werror, which is nowadays controlled by CONFIG -= production_build.

This actually fixes the build, as the QT_FOR_CONFIG += core-private which
would have been required for qtConfig(private_tests) is missing.

Task-number: QTBUG-55950
